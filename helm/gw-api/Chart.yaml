description: A Helm chart for FastAPI Gateway (gw-api) with 2 backed services (users and orders).

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version.
version: 0.1.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed.
# This version number should be # incremented each time you make changes to the application. 
appVersion: "1.0.0"
